# Lightweight pre-release and migration plan

**Status:** planning only; **no production release approval**. Pre-release changes are focused and committed to `main` (no mandatory PR), but the original unit-only CI statement is historical. Current automated path-filtered CI includes synthetic Next.js browser/route builds and, for relevant security paths, real disposable Caddy + Spring/Tomcat + PostgreSQL 18 + Chromium acceptance. Passing an isolated CI gate is not approval to activate real accounts, endpoints, employee data or Agent collection.

## Local development checkpoints
- Changes are small, atomically committed and documented; never force-push main.
- Run relevant local Rust formatting/compiler, Java compilation, TS typecheck/build and actual unit tests where code exists.
- Updated schema/API? Update contracts + migration and test compatibility. Authorization/credential changes require targeted manual validation.
- Only tag a milestone as an experimental preview after reproducing startup, TLS, enroll/heartbeat and stop/restart on synthetic endpoints.

## Proposed versioning
`v0.1.x`: enrollment, heartbeat, outbox, dashboard with REST + WSS.
`v0.2.x`: app/security activity, scoped search, retention.
`v0.3.x`: approved recording and media flow.
`v0.4.x`: installers, recovery, diagnostics.
`v1.0`: after security, platform and integration acceptance.

The repo initially contains only design docs; filenames, installer formats and command examples are **targets**, not actual release artifacts.

## Upgrade/rollback design
- Version Java/Flyway PostgreSQL migrations and Rust SQLite migrations explicitly. Always back up and test restore before destructive schema changes. Avoid rolling back by replacing a live SQLite/WAL database file.
- Support overlapping API/event schema versions for previously enrolled agents. Agent must refuse unsupported server policy expansions.
- Preserve device_id and monotonically increasing sequences across compatible upgrades; lost keys/DB trigger fresh enrollment and historical linkage.
- Record installer architecture, checksums and upgrade path for Windows 11 x64 and first validated Linux configuration.

## Release readiness boundary
Passing synthetic integration/Chromium CI is **necessary but insufficient** for production rollout. NXT-10 demonstrated disposable direct-origin isolation and protected HTML/RSC; NXT-11 reviews publicly cacheable static assets, explicit Next.js network namespace/firewall topology, and real login usability separately. The production Caddy Console remains disabled and Next.js authorized routes are unmounted. Formal v1.0 still requires real deployment integration/negative tests, independent UI accessibility review, real-device tests, signed distribution review, organization/privacy sign-off and exercised backup/restore.
